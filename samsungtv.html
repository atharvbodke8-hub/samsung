<p>Samsung is a South Korean multinational conglomerate founded in 1938,</br>
 known globally as a leader in electronics and technology, with a diverse business portfolio and a leading position in the Television market</br>

Samsung TVs use Vision AI and NQ4 AI processors to improve picture and sound quality in real time. Gemini, </br>

a voice assistant, is available on compatible Google TV devices or certain Samsung mobile products, but not currently on Samsung TVs. </br>

Samsung TV AI Features</br>

Modern Samsung QLED and OLED smart TVs use built-in AI processors, such as the NQ4 AI Gen3 Processor and the Q4 AI Processor, to optimize viewing. Key AI features include: </br>

Picture Optimization: The AI analyzes each scene to enhance brightness, contrast, and color saturation, providing a crisp and vibrant 4K UHD picture,</br>

 even when upscaling lower-resolution content.</br>

Audio Optimization: Features like Adaptive Sound Pro and Object Tracking Sound (OTS Lite) analyze room acoustics and content type to deliver</br>


 an immersive sound experience, automatically optimizing dialogue, music, and sound effects.</br>

Seamless Interface: The TVs run on Samsung's Tizen OS, which provides a seamless and personalized user interface with access to various streaming services like Netflix, </br>

YouTube, and the free ad-supported platform Samsung TV Plus.</br>

Multiple Voice Assistants: Though Google Assistant was discontinued on Samsung TVs as of March 2024, the TVs support other voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and</br>

 Samsung's Bixby for control and navigation. </br>

Samsung UHD (Ultra High Definition) TVs are a popular line of 4K resolution smart televisions that offer a significantly enhanced picture quality over standard Full HD models.</br>
 They serve as Samsung's entry-level to mid-range 4K options and use LED backlighting with LCD displays. 
Key Features and Technology
1)Resolution: Samsung UHD TVs have a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels, which is four times the pixel count of a 1080p Full HD TV, resulting in a crisp, clear, and detailed image.
Picture Quality Enhancements:</br>
2)Crystal Processor 4K: A powerful processor that optimizes the TV's performance, enhances color expression, and performs 4K upscaling,</br>
 which converts lower-resolution content to near-4K quality.</br>
3)HDR (High Dynamic Range): Increases the range of light levels to reveal more detail in both very bright and very dark scenes.
4)PurColor/Dynamic Crystal Color: Technologies that produce a wide spectrum of colors for a vibrant, lifelike picture.
5)Motion Xcelerator: Estimates and compensates frames to improve motion smoothness, reducing blur in fast-paced content like sports or action movies.
6)Smart TV Features: Most Samsung UHD TVs run on the Tizen™ operating system, providing access to a wide range of streaming apps (Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, etc.)</br>
 and free live channels via Samsung TV Plus.</br>
7)Voice Assistants: Many models are compatible with multiple voice assistants, including Samsung Bixby, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant.</br>
8)SmartThings: A built-in smart hub allows you to connect, monitor, and control other compatible smart home devices directly from your TV</br>.
9)Connectivity: Includes multiple HDMI and USB ports, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connectivity for seamless integration with other devices.</br>
Popular Samsung UHD TV Lines</br>
Crystal UHD: This is the primary line of Samsung's entry-level 4K LED TVs, known for offering great 4K picture quality and smart features at an accessible price point.</br>
 The "Crystal" designation refers to the enhanced color technology.</br>
QLED 4K: While technically a step up from standard "Crystal UHD" due to the addition of a Quantum Dot layer for better color and brightness,</br>
 these are also 4K UHD resolution TVs and are part of the broader 4K ecosystem. </br>
To get a better idea of which model might fit your needs, you can explore the full range of Samsung TVs on the official Samsung.com website or retailers like Amazon.in. </br>
I can provide information on specific models and their features, or we can look at a side-by-side comparison of the different UHD series</br>
 (e.g., U8000 vs QLED)—covering key differences in picture quality and price. </br>

<h2><u>samsung tv neo</u></h2></br>
<img src = "\Users\D_IBM_COMP_24\Pictures\samtvneo.jpg" align= "right" alt = "samtvneo" height="300px" width="600px"></br>
<p>Samsung Neo QLED 4K TV offers an array of great features to enhance your viewing experience! It includes Quantum Matrix Technology,</br>
 Neural Quantum Processor 4K, Dolby Atmos®, EyeComfort Mode, OTS, and much more.</br>
Key Technologies:</br>
1)Quantum Matrix Technology (Mini LED Backlighting): This is the core of Neo QLED. The traditional, larger LEDs are replaced by tens of thousands of much smaller Mini LEDs </br>
(around 1/40th the size of conventional LEDs). This allows for many more local dimming zones, providing ultra-fine and precise control over brightness and contrast, </br>
resulting in deeper blacks and brighter whites.</br>
2)Quantum Dot Technology: Like standard QLED TVs, Neo QLED uses a layer of Quantum Dots to produce a billion shades of vibrant and accurate colors, delivering 100% color volume.</br>
3)NQ AI Processor: Powered by numerous AI neural networks (the latest models use NQ4 AI Gen3 or NQ8 AI Gen3 processors, depending on 4K/8K resolution), </br>
these chips enhance both picture and sound quality in real-time. A key feature is AI Upscaling, which can take lower-resolution content and enhance it to near-4K or even 8K quality.</br>
4)Anti-Glare & Wide Viewing Angle: Many Neo QLED models feature a "Glare Free" screen designed to reduce reflections from ambient light, along with a wide viewing </br>
angle so the picture quality holds up well even when viewed from the side.</br>
5)Object Tracking Sound (OTS): This audio technology uses multiple built-in speakers (e.g., side and up-firing) to create a dynamic, 3D-like sound experience where </br>
the audio moves along with the on-screen action.</br>
